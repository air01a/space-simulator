Python satellite simulator using newton &amp; kepler

Python satellite simulator using kepler laws & newton (2D).

You can pilote the orbiter (orient, start/stop engine), see in real time the orbit transformation, and initiate atmosphere reentry.
Arrow left and right to orient the spacecraft, upper arrow to start engine, down arrow to stop, W,X,C to accelerate/slow down time and A&Q to zoom / unzoom.

Final goal is to be able to start a rocket from earth and go to the moon.
